# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **Logistic Regression** and hosted with **Streamlit**. The goal is to provide a **cost-effective and accessible alternative** to expensive heart disease tests using **Machine Learning**.

The project utilizes a **small dataset** for training, and despite its limitations, it achieves good accuracy.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [Heart Disease Predictor](https://heart-diseasepredictor.streamlit.app/)  
📂 **GitHub Repository:** [View Code & Dataset](https://github.com/AbhiKesarwani/Logistic-Regression/tree/main)

## 📌 Features
✅ Simple UI for user-friendly interaction (Built with Streamlit)  
✅ Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input  
✅ Visualization of key features to enhance interpretability  
✅ Easy deployment and accessibility  
✅ Built as part of a learning journey in Machine Learning

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is a small heart disease dataset, which includes key features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ST Depression
- Exercise Induced Angina, etc.
